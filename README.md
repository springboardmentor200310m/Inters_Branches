🎵 Audio-Based Musical Instrument Recognition using CNNs

This project implements an end-to-end audio-based musical instrument recognition system using Mel spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Raw audio signals are transformed into time–frequency representations, enabling deep learning models to identify the musical instrument present in an audio clip.

The system includes a trained CNN backend and a Streamlit-based frontend for interactive inference.

🚀 Project Highlights

🎧 Audio classification using deep learning

📊 Mel spectrogram–based feature extraction

🧠 CNN model implemented in PyTorch

🖥️ Interactive Streamlit web interface

🥇 Top-1 and Top-3 predictions with confidence

📈 Model evaluation with standard metrics

📌 Project Overview

Input: Audio file (.wav / .mp3)

Preprocessing: Mel Spectrogram generation using Librosa

Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Framework: PyTorch

Output:

Predicted instrument (Top-1)

Top-3 predictions with confidence scores

Frontend: Streamlit web app for real-time inference

Confidence scores are normalized across top predictions to improve interpretability for users.

🧠 Key Insight

This is not an image classification project.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Although CNNs are used, the input is audio, not images.
Spectrograms act as an intermediate time–frequency representation, allowing CNNs to learn discriminative audio features for instrument recognition.

📌 Limitations

Model confidence may be lower for:

Noisy audio

Short clips

Multiple instruments playing simultaneously

No real-time audio capture (file-based inference only)

🚧 Future Improvements

Improve accuracy using deeper CNN architectures

Apply data augmentation (time stretching, pitch shifting)

Use transfer learning on audio-specific models

Add real-time microphone input

Deploy on cloud platforms (Hugging Face Spaces / Render)
