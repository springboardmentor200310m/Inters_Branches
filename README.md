## How to Run model code.ipynb

This repository does not contain large model and dataset files due to GitHub size limits.

### Step 1 – Download Large Files
Download the following files from Google Drive:
<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10xWtwPecNy8hhsQV0atylsU1bL4JltB8>

Required files:
- final_cnn_model_m3.h5
- X.npy
- y.npy

### Step 2 – Place Files Here

After download, copy those files into:

Demo/MileStone_3/

Folder structure should be:

MileStone_3/
 ├── model code.ipynb
 ├── final_cnn_model_m3.h5
 ├── X.npy
 ├── y.npy

### Step 3 – Run Notebook

Open:
model code.ipynb

and run all cells in order.

## Large Files

Due to GitHub size limitations, the following large files are uploaded to Google Drive:

- X.npy – [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10xWtwPecNy8hhsQV0atylsU1bL4JltB8]
- y.npy – [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10xWtwPecNy8hhsQV0atylsU1bL4JltB8]
- final_cnn_model_m3.h5 – [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10xWtwPecNy8hhsQV0atylsU1bL4JltB8]

Download these files and place them inside:
MileStone_3/ folder before running the notebook.
